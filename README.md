# VerbalLieDetectionWithLLM
This is the repository that contains the code used to produce the results of the paper Verbal Lie Detection using  Large Language Models

The code for the fine-tuning is divided in this way:

CvexpSc1Decop, CvexpSc1Hyppocorpus, CvexpSc1Intention contain the code for the experiments regarding the Scenario 1 with small and base model with Opinion, Memory and Intention datasets respectively.

CvexpSc2 contains the code for the scenario 2 with small and base model

CvexpSc3Small and CvexpSc3Base contain the code for the scenario 3 with small and base model respectively.
